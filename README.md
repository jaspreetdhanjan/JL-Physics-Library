<h2>Introduction</h2>
A basic physics library for 2D Java applications. A lot of the code is unfinished and unoptimised â€“ it is still very much a work-in-progress. This is a companion API to my <a href="https://github.com/jaspreetdhanjan/JL-Graphics-Library">JL-Graphics-Library</a>

Created by Jaspreet Dhanjan.
